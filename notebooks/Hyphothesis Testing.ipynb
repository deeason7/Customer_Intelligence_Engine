    "#### Test 1: Impact of Product Variety on Customer Value\n",
    "##### 1. Business Question\n",
    "Do customers who purchase a wider variety of products provide more future value to the business? This is a crucial question for inventory and marketing strategy. If product variety is a key driver of value, the business should focus on cross-selling and product discovery.\n",
    "##### 2. Analytical Approach\n",
    "Measure \"product variety\" by counting the number of unique StockCodes each customer has purchased. We will then split customers into two groups: \"Low Variety\" and \"High Variety\" (split by the median). Finally, use an independent t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the average 12-month CLV between these two groups.\n",
    "##### 3. Hypotheses\n",
    "        - Null Hypothesis(H_0): There is no significant difference in the mean CLV between customers who purchase a low variety of products and those who purchse a high variety.\n",
    "        - Alternative Hypothesis(H_a): There is a significant in the mean CLV between the two groups.\n",
    "##### 4. Significance Level\n",
    "Standard significance level of a = 0.05. If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hyopthesis."

    "#### Inference\n",
    "The ANOVA test is highly statistically significant (p-value is effectively 0), definitively proving that our customer segments have fundamentally different behaviors regarding the variety of products they purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result, combined with our previous findings, paints a complete, three-dimensional picture of what makes a customer valuable. Our best customers, like \"Champions,\" are superior across all key behavioral dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They visit more often (higher Frequency).\n",
    "2. They spend more per visit (higher Average Purchase Value).\n",
    "3. They explore more of the product catalog (higher Product Variety).\n",

    "##### Strategic Implication\n",
    "The most effective path to increasing customer value is a three-pronged strategy designed to nurture customers across all three of these dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encourage Repeat Visits through re-engagement campaigns and loyalty programs.\n",
    "2. Increase Basket Value by upselling and recommending premium products to high-APV segments.\n",
    "3. Promote Product Discovery with cross-selling features and personalized recommendations to increase the variety of items a customer purchases."
